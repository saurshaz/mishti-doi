# Parse Server
Parse is a Backend as a Service. This app provides an example [Parse Server](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server) that you can re-use to provide a backend for your own apps.

We also provide an example [To-do app](https://gomix.com/#!/project/parse-todo) that works with the  Parse Server, so you can see it in action, and you can also set up [Parse Dashboard](https://gomix.com/#!/project/parse-dashboard) to manage your Parse apps.
